====== Dashboard Items ======

Our UI is made up of one Dashboard that displays multiple Locations.
A Location is a way to group together sensors in a logical way.

Examples of a location may be:
  * A greenhouse containing 6 soil sensors, a CO² sensor, and a Lux Sensor.
  * A Hotel Floor where the Floor is the location, and each room has a Temperature and Humidity sensor.
  * An office building with multiple sensors.

Lets have a look at a "Demo Location":

{{:dashboarditem.png?400 |}} As you can see, there are multiple sections to a location.
First, lets look at the top, you will see an outdoors Temperature. In this case it is 18°C.
On the right, you will find the current Rainfall, Humidity, and Wind Speed. These data points
are pulled from your local weather station.

*IF you have a Weather Station provided by us, the top weather data will be replaced by your location's weather station data.

Next down, we have the name of your location. In this case it is "Kevin's House" on the left, followed by a Blue Arrow button that will bring you to the
"Location Detail" page.

After the name, you will find a list of sensors.
Your List of sensors will have a GREEN or RED stripe on the far left, this indicates if your sensor has recently sent data. If the color indicator is displaying RED then
it may indicate a problem with the sensor.

Next, you will find the specific sensor name, and a non-exostive list of important data points. To view ALL datapoints that the sensor returns, Click the arrow on the far right of the sensor list item.
